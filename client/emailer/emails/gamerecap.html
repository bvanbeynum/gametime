				the field. Families must not remove or move cones that will be placed around the 
				field on Sunday. Families must enter the field by using the gate that is closest

			<h3 class="textSubHeader">Game Recap</h3>

				What a great game. Everyone should be very proud of how they played today. As I was telling
				them after the game how important everyone in this win because this is a team effort. 
				Everyone is important on the team, if they are the primary target, they are clearing out a 
				defender, or if they are protecting a zone on defense. I was very happy how well everyone
				played for their first game. The first games are always the most difficult because of how
				new everything is. This is especially true for those new to the 10U division with all the
				different rules and the speed of the game. They have worked very hard to get to this point
				today and I think it really shows in the score.<br>
				<br>
				I would like to send a special shout out to our team cheer squad. It is great to have such
				great support from the families. It really makes it fun when everyone is enjoying watching
				the games and is sharing their support. These games are such fun and it really gets the kids
				excited when they can hear the support from their biggest fans. Especially when we have these
				really hot games, it can be difficult for the kids to stay engaged, but hearing the support
				from the families is so helpful. Thank you all for your support and for making the games fun
				for everyone.

			<h3 class="textSubHeader">Optional Practice</h3>
			
			<p class="textContent">
				<img src="/emailer/images/cam.jpg" class="cam" />
				Monday 9/10, 5:30PM - <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/KEY6chPjE1p" target="_new">Lookout field</a><br>
				<br>
				Next week we will be against what will probably be the toughest team of the division. Since they
				are in the same confrence as we are, if we want to have a shot at the championship game we will
				need to beat them. I would like to be able to throw them for a loop with a new play they haven't
				seen before. This would be the Tag play in the playbook that would be a bit of a trick for them.
				If possible, I'd like to have an additional practice on Monday in order for the kids to learn
				this new play. It is going to be the most complicated play we will run and it will take a little
				extra for the kids to pick it up. If it is possible to make it on Monday at 5:30 it would be very
				helpful.

			<h3 class="textSubHeader">Team Video</h3>
			
			<p class="textContent">
				<img src="/emailer/images/cooper.jpg" class="cooper" />
				<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/b5ScJBgR3adbybMU7" target="_new">Team Video Album</a><br>
				<br>
				You may have noticed my younger son, Cooper (and others), running back and forth across the field
				with a camera. I like to be able to have video of each of the games that I can share with everyone
				from each game. I have a shared Google Photos album that is linked above where you can view any of
				the video from each game. We try to get video of each play so everyone can relive the excitement
				each week. It is difficult to get every shot just right, so you may not see that perfect shot you
				were looking for, but hopefully everyone will enjoy. Feel free to download any video you'd like to
				be able to keep.<br>
				<br>
				At the end of the season I will put together a highlight video of the entire team that will feature
				everyone. It is something I enjoy putting together and it is fun for the kids to watch at the end
				of the season.
